# WP Site Replicator

Quickly create replicas of large production websites from WordPress eXtended RSS (WXR) export files.

## Usage

Please note that this implementation relies on writing directly to the WP database so both post and term tables should be empty. All existing users with the same login name will be deleted and new users created with password `wordpress`.


### Export Content

Export content from the source site:

1. Export the site content using the [WordPress Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-importer/). To run the export, navigate to "Tools &rarr; Export" in your site dashboard.

2. Export the site options using the [WP Options Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/options-importer/) plugin. The output should be a single `options.json` file.


### Prepare Import

1. Parse the exported WXR files into JSON files for site users, terms and posts:

	   wp replicator wxr-to-json path/to/wxr/directory

   where `path/to/wxr/directory` is the path to the directory with all the XML files.

   All XML files `path/to/wxr/files/*.xml` are parsed and stored in the `path/to/wxr/directory/json` directory -- `users.json`, `terms.json` and `posts-*.json`.


### Import Content

Please note that you may need to specify `--url` for all commands if you're running WordPress multisite.

1. Empty the site content where you want to import the content:

	   wp site empty --yes

2. Import options:

	   wp replicator import-options "path/to/options.json"

   where `path/to/options.json` is the path to the exported options.

3. Import users:

	   wp replicator import-users "path/to/users.json"

   where `path/to/users.json` is the path the user list generated from the XML export.

4. Import taxonomies and terms:

	   wp replicator import-terms "path/to/terms.json"

   where `path/to/terms.json` is the path the term list generated from the XML export.

5. Import posts:

	   wp replicator import-posts "path/to/posts-*.json"
